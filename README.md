# egr

**egr** is a small Go package that extends [errgroup](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup) with a typed channel, allowing you to push items into a queue and process them in concurrent goroutines with error propagation. The goal of the package is to provide a standard way to use errgroup, while maintaining most of its flexibility.

## Installation
